## version 0.1.4

This bot is deployed in a separate container and connected to your platform ID. This allows you to broadcast an audio stream, and it is also possible to store commands in a separate database based on mongoDB. Spring Session provides an API and implementations for managing a user’s session information.

Spring Session makes it trivial to support clustered sessions without being tied to an application container specific solution. It also provides transparent integration with:

HttpSession - allows replacing the HttpSession in an application container (i.e. Tomcat) neutral way, with support for providing session IDs in headers to work with RESTful APIs

WebSocket - provides the ability to keep the HttpSession alive when receiving WebSocket messages

WebSession - allows replacing the Spring WebFlux’s WebSession in an application container neutral way

The main variables

DISCORD_BOT_KEY	== The discord API key

POSTGRES_LOCATION == The URL of postgres
